Through our investigation we hope to explore the following: where are the most cases concentrated around the country? Has bodycam usage changed over time? Visualizations grouping total incidents by year and comparing quantitative values through area or length can answer this question. What is the distribution of shootings across race, gender, and age, and is there a relationship between these variables? Which cases involved victims with mental health issues? Were they armed?</p><h4 id="question-1---where-are-cases-most-concentrated?">Question <!-- -->1 <!-- -->- Where are cases most concentrated?</h4><img src="./static/images/shootingsbystate.png" alt="example"/><h4 id="question-2---what-is-the-distribution-of-shootings-across-race,-gender,-and-age,-and-is-there-a-relationship-between-these-variables?">Question <!-- -->2 <!-- -->- What is the distribution of shootings across race, gender, and age, and is there a relationship between these variables?</h4><p>To better understand the data, we looked at simple demographic information, including race, gender, and age. By comparing the distribution of age and gender for each race, we can gain insight into similarities and/or disparities among police treatment of certain races.</p><p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/AgeDistByRace/AgeDistWB?:language=en&amp;:display_count=y&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="400"></iframe><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/GenderByRace/Dashboard2?:language=en&amp;:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="400"></iframe>
While these visualizations show that a plurality of incidents had white victims, that is by total incident count only; per capita rates tell a very different story that we do not want to erase. Each race showed similar distributions of age and gender, albeit with a small sample size on some of the data points. The demographics support our assumption that young men would make up the majority of cases. Prior intuition also supports the fact that white victims were slightly more numerous than black victims, despite being a much larger portion of the overall population (per capita rates are clearly not equal).</p><h4 id="question-3---has-bodycam-usage-changed-over-time?">Question <!-- -->3 <!-- -->- Has bodycam usage changed over time?</h4><p>While investing cases of fatal police shootings, it is clear that having body camera evidence can make a huge difference in the bringing justice to victims involved. The use of body cameras “increase the publics’ trust and confidence in law enforcement as well as bring a quicker resolution, improves officer safety, and prevent crime” as mentioned in a <a href="https://latech.us/blog/police-weigh-benefits-of-body-cameras-against-public-perception#:~:text=Body%20cameras%20increase%20the%20publics,officer%20safety%2C%20and%20prevents%20crime">LA TECH article</a>. Knowing all of the benefits of using body cameras, have the use of them increased over time? To investigate this we plotted all counts of body camera data for fatal shooting cases since 2015 and separated the instances into the body cams being off and on. </p><p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/fatalshooting/Dashboard1?:language=en&amp;:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="600"></iframe>
From this visualization we can see that although since 2015 the federal government has provided over <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/body-cameras-are-seen-as-key-to-police-reform-but-do-they-increase-accountability">$23 million dollars</a> to expand the use of body cams, in theses cases, they were usually turned off. There is slight increase of body cameras being on for more cases in months of widely known cases. This could be attributed to the increased news and public awareness during those moments in time. </p><h5 id="question-4---which-cases-involved-victims-with-mental-health-issues?-were-they-armed?">Question <!-- -->4 <!-- -->- Which cases involved victims with mental health issues? Were they armed?</h5><p>Wanting to find out how mental illness impacts patterns in fatal police shootings we decided to first investigate the count 
differnce between unarmed and armed individuals along with whether or not they were reported to have signs of mental illness.<iframe width="200%" height="500" frameBorder="0" src="https://observablehq.com/embed/@cristianswift/starting-visulizations?cells=Armed_vs_unarmed_mental_illness_time_use"></iframe>
From the figure above we see that there is significantly more cases of people involved in fatal police shootings that were armed.
Though it is very important to note that if an individual had any sort of “wepond” they could use, they would be counted as armed.
For example other than guns, some cases reported to have people being armed with cars, wasp spray, a walking stick, a wrench, and much more.
Additionally, as we look into the relationships of signs of mental health, it can be noticed that there doesen’t seem to be any discrepriancies of significance.</p><p>Though lets take a deeper look into this and see if this narrative still lines up when we take into account proportions of these incidents in a figure that uses a normalized range.<img src="./static/images/Relationship_of_armed_mental_illness.png" alt="example"/>
From this figure we can take a much better look at the relationship between signs of mental health and armed
status usuing proportion instead of just count of records. Though it does not reveal any variance in the fatal
shootings of people who have displayed signs of mental illness who were or were not armed.</p><p>There weren’t any revealing patterns for mental health in regards to armed status, next we will investigate whether or not their are any correlatiions with signs of mental illness and race.<iframe width="150%" height="300" frameBorder="0" src="https://observablehq.com/embed/@cristianswift/starting-visulizations?cells=mental_health_race"></iframe></p><p>In this figure you can select differnce races to highlight and veiw the proportion of which that race belongs to from the dataset.
Most notably white individuals increase in proportion of occurances for fata police shootings when comparing no signs of mental
illness (false) to individuals with signs of mental illness (true). In general it is observed that other races are subjected to higher ratees of incidents when no signs of mental illnesss are present.</p></div></div></div></div>
